# Challenge TO-DO 


## Introduction

In this file we add all the things which we need to do or want to add for the final product.


It is devided in 3 parts: data ingestion, signal analysis, user interface

## Data Ingestion

- [x] .env file creation and setup
- [x] conda environment setup
- [x] test the API and get some test data to pandas dataframes
- [x] write a script which can be easily called to import a specific dataframe
- [ ] write functions to import a lot more data in one single dataframe
- [ ] optimize usability of code and functions
- [ ] better understand how to use the predictions of the price for analysis



## Signal Analysis

- [ ] start to extract simple statistical information


## User Interface

- [ ] decide how to structure the user interface and chat
